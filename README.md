# Echo-Dark
AI Music Recognition (FUNCTIONAL HTML FILE) 





It is NOT a production-ready application and NOT a standalone product.

This project exists solely to:

Test UI/UX concepts

Experiment with audio processing techniques

Validate music recognition flows

Prototype interaction patterns

👉 It will be integrated into Cubic Music as a feature module after validation.

🧪 Purpose of This Prototype

Pure HTML + CSS + JavaScript

No backend architecture

No persistent cloud fingerprint database

Used to experiment, benchmark, and refine

Serves as a proof-of-concept, not final implementation

Think of this as:

“Does this work well enough to justify a native / hybrid Cubic Music implementation?”

🎨 UI Improvements (Echo Dark Theme)

This prototype includes advanced UI experimentation, focused on a modern, Android-friendly experience:

🌙 Complete dark mode with gradient accents

📱 Android-optimized responsive design

🎤 Siri-like circular microphone button with pulse animation

🧩 Professional card-based layout

👆 Touch-optimized large action buttons

✨ Smooth animations and transitions

🔔 Visual feedback via status indicators and states

🎧 Audio Processing Advancements (Experimental)

The audio stack is experimental and research-focused, used for learning and validation:

🔇 Advanced Noise Reduction

Adaptive noise profiling

Dynamic noise suppression

🎚️ Dynamic Range Compression

Improved normalization

Consistent amplitude levels

📈 Spectral Analysis

MFCC calculations

Spectral flux

Spectral centroid

Spectral rolloff

🎼 Music Pattern Detection

Intelligent music vs noise detection

🔁 Multi-API Fallback System

Automatically tries multiple recognition services

📊 Real-time visualizer

Advanced waveform & frequency spectrum display

⚡ Performance Optimizations

Special attention was given to resource management, especially for mobile testing:

🧹 Complete cleanup when listening stops
(all audio processors disconnected)

🧠 Memory-efficient buffer management

🎞️ requestAnimationFrame for smooth visualization

📲 Web Audio API tuning for mobile browsers

⏱️ Automatic stop after 15 seconds max

🔋 Reduced unnecessary CPU usage

🧩 Professional Feature Experiments

These features are UI/UX tests, not final product guarantees:

🔔 Toast notification system

⏳ Loading overlay with spinner

📊 Confidence meter for recognition matches

📈 Performance statistics tracking

🕘 Local history storage (browser-based)

⚙️ Settings management (prototype-level)

❌ Robust error handling & user feedback

📱 Mobile-Specific Optimizations

Designed primarily with Android mobile browsers in mind:

👆 Touch-friendly UI

📐 Safe-area padding (notch support)

🔍 Performance monitoring hooks

🔋 Battery-efficient audio processing

⏸️ Automatic pause on app minimization

🎙️ High-quality audio capture settings

🚧 What This Is NOT

❌ Not a Shazam replacement

❌ Not production-ready

❌ Not optimized for scale

❌ Not using a proprietary fingerprint database

❌ Not intended for public distribution

🔮 Future Integration: Cubic Music

This prototype will be:

Refactored

Modularized

Rewritten where necessary

Integrated into Cubic Music as a native or hybrid feature

Only validated concepts from this prototype will survive into production.
