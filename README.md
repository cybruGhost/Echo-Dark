# Echo-Dark
AI Music Recognition (FUNCTIONAL HTML FILE) 


⚠️ **Important Notice**  
This is **NOT a production-ready application** and **NOT a standalone product**.

Echo-Dark is a **function-level HTML-based testing prototype** created to experiment, validate, and refine concepts that will later be integrated into **Cubic Music**.

## 🧪 Purpose of This Prototype
[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/cubic-music/localized.svg?style=flat)](https://crowdin.com/project/cubic-music)

This project exists solely to:

- Test **UI/UX concepts**
- Experiment with **audio processing techniques**
- Validate **music recognition flows**
- Prototype **interaction patterns**

👉 After validation, selected components will be **integrated into Cubic Music as a feature module**.

Think of this prototype as:

> “Does this work well enough to justify a native or hybrid Cubic Music implementation?”

---

## 🧱 Technical Scope

- Pure **HTML + CSS + JavaScript**
- No backend architecture
- No persistent cloud fingerprint database
- Used to **experiment, benchmark, and refine**
- Serves as a **proof-of-concept**, not a final implementation

---

## 🎨 UI Improvements (Echo Dark Theme)

This prototype includes advanced UI experimentation focused on a modern, Android-friendly experience:

- 🌙 Complete **dark mode** with gradient accents
- 📱 **Android-optimized responsive design**
- 🎤 **Siri-like circular microphone button** with pulse animation
- 🧩 Professional **card-based layout**
- 👆 Touch-optimized **large action buttons**
- ✨ Smooth animations and transitions
- 🔔 Visual feedback via status indicators and states

---

## 🎧 Audio Processing Advancements (Experimental)

The audio stack is **experimental and research-focused**, used for learning and validation:

### 🔇 Advanced Noise Reduction
- Adaptive noise profiling
- Dynamic noise suppression

### 🎚️ Dynamic Range Compression
- Improved normalization
- Consistent amplitude levels

### 📈 Spectral Analysis
- MFCC calculations
- Spectral flux
- Spectral centroid
- Spectral rolloff

### 🎼 Music Pattern Detection
- Intelligent music vs noise detection

### 🔁 Multi-API Fallback System
- Automatically tries multiple recognition services

### 📊 Real-time Visualizer
- Advanced waveform display
- Frequency spectrum visualization

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

Special attention was given to **resource management**, especially for mobile testing:

- 🧹 Complete cleanup when listening stops  
  *(all audio processors disconnected)*
- 🧠 Memory-efficient buffer management
- 🎞️ `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth visualization
- 📲 Web Audio API tuning for mobile browsers
- ⏱️ Automatic stop after **15 seconds maximum**
- 🔋 Reduced unnecessary CPU usage

---

## 🧩 Professional Feature Experiments

These features are **UI/UX experiments**, not production guarantees:

- 🔔 Toast notification system
- ⏳ Loading overlay with spinner
- 📊 Confidence meter for recognition matches
- 📈 Performance statistics tracking
- 🕘 Local history storage (browser-based)
- ⚙️ Settings management (prototype-level)
- ❌ Robust error handling and user feedback

---

## 📱 Mobile-Specific Optimizations

Designed primarily with **Android mobile browsers** in mind:

- 👆 Touch-friendly interface
- 📐 Safe-area padding (notch support)
- 🔍 Performance monitoring hooks
- 🔋 Battery-efficient audio processing
- ⏸️ Automatic pause on app minimization
- 🎙️ High-quality audio capture settings

---

## 🚧 What This Is NOT

- ❌ Not a Shazam replacement
- ❌ Not production-ready
- ❌ Not optimized for scale
- ❌ Not using a proprietary fingerprint database
- ❌ Not intended for public distribution

---

## 🔮 Future Integration: Cubic Music

This prototype will eventually be:

- Refactored
- Modularized
- Rewritten where necessary
- Integrated into **Cubic Music** as a **native or hybrid feature**

Only **validated concepts** from this prototype will survive into production.
